Overview of the project:

My database is loosely based on a blogging and digital publishing website Medium.com. The website describes itself as an extensive publishing platform where over 100 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking.  The idea behind Medium.com is to be a place or a so-called medium where ideas take shape, take off, and spark powerful conversations. Both an expert and a blogging novice can share their ideas and deepen their understanding of the world. 
The platform is open to anyone, and no topic is off limits as long as it is within their curation guidelines. However, if one wants to start publishing their own posts on the website, one needs to sign up for a free account to do so. Medium.com also has an option of paid membership either with monthly or yearly contributions. Paid membership allows a member to have an unlimited article viewing privileges with no advertisements and directly support writers who are part of the Partner Program. 
The database of the platform would be a lot more complex than the one I am employing. The principle behind my database architecture is the fact that any member of the platform can become an author of a post. Before publishing, an author selects publication name (if it has one) where the story is going to be featured in. The platform also has employed editors who moderate content and make sure members follow the guidelines. 
As a disclaimer, I have never published anything on Medium.com, so they way publishing works is only my understanding from what I gathered reading the website. 

Mission Statement
The purpose of the Medium.com website database is to maintain the data we generate, and to supply information that supports the publishing services we provide to our writing members and browsing services we provide to our reading audience.
